# Data Science Engineering Roles
#### Bloom Institute of Technology

While we no longer assign roles in Labs the materials are still divided into roles.
This is beneficial in two ways:
1. It's more organized and matches how we build Labs apps.
2. The DS engineering roles you find in the industry generally map to these roles, or some combination of them.

It is recommended to begin with the notebooks in this repo. 
For some of us this might be review, feel free to skim the material if this is the case.
1. Data Engineer: `Data_Eng.ipynb`
2. ML Engineer: `ML_Eng.ipynb`
3. ML Ops Engineer: `ML_Ops.ipynb`

Then move on to the corresponding packages in the root of the repo.
1. Data Engineer: `data_model/`
2. ML Engineer: `machine_learning/`
3. ML Ops Engineer: `app/`
